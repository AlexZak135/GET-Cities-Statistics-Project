## Background

Over the past decade, the presence of women in the traditionally male-dominated 
tech industry has steadily increased. This rise of women taking on roles in tech 
signifies a major stride towards enhanced gender equality within this field. As 
the number of women entering the tech industry grows, it becomes essential to 
foster an equitable environment that encompasses fair treatment, appropriate 
compensation, and abundant career growth opportunities. In light of this, I have 
joined forces with a non-profit organization known as Gender Equality in Tech 
(GET) Cities. They are committed to promoting inclusivity in the tech industry
in cities throughout the United States. Their initiatives guide more women along
a clear career path, encouraging them to initiate and sustain successful careers
in tech, which in turn leads to a more dynamic tech industry. Although they 
recognize the progress that has been made, they continue to aspire for a greater 
presence of women in the tech sector.

## Research Focus and Data Overview

To gain a deeper understanding of the experiences, perceptions, and outlooks of 
women in tech, GET Cities carried out a survey from April to September 2022. The
respondents consisted of 406 women working full-time in the tech industry across 
three Midwestern states: Illinois, Wisconsin, and Indiana. The results from this 
survey were used in this analysis after initial data cleaning was conducted to get
the results into a tidier format.

## Methodology

I analyzed the results of this survey using various techniques, such as data 
visualization and sentiment analysis, to unveil a multitude of trends and insights 
regarding the experiences of women in the Midwestern tech sector. For example, the 
vast majority of the responses from the technologists regarding their experiences
in tech were fairly positive, and most senior-level technologists were required to
work more than the typical 40 hours per week to succeed in their given roles. All in 
all, the outcomes of my analysis underscore the achievements that GET Cities has made 
since its inception in January 2020. At the same time, it also points out areas
requiring further improvements to enhance the experiences of women in the tech industry.
